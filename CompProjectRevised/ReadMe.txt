This is the revised physics project. The first solar system simulation was
 fine however it wasnt incorporating the computational physics we used in class. Therefore we remaking the simulation.
The simulation will be hard coded use matlab script. First we will intialize our planets with their given intial velocity, mass, and poistion.
Then we will add the gravitational field and use the RK4 method to solve the second order differential equation.
